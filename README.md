Description:
This C# code was made for use in Streamerbot, specifically for tinting meshes related to vtuber models.

Instructions:
To use this code, in streamerbot, set up your point redeem as a trigger for your action. Then in sub actions, right click and select Core > C# > Execute C# Code.
Place this code in the window that appears and press compile to ensure there are no issues.

Then right click again, select integrations > vtubestudio > colortint. In the color field type %rawInput%
The filters will need to be adjusted according to the mesh of your model, but if your hair meshes are named 'Hair1, hair2' etc for example, you can filter by 'contains' and type hair.

From here, test your redeem against a few colors in the library or by using hash codes.
